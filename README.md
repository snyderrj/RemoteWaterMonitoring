# RemoteWaterMonitoring
Building a remote watering system for a cattle farm.

This repository should hold everything needed to run the project. From the front-end database and python scripts to the backend arduino and raspberry pi scripts. I'll be keeping this REAME updated as we work on the project, and have individual READMEs in each folder with more detail for each topic.
